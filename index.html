  <h2>Basic Info</h2>
  <p>Hi, I'm Evan. I'm a 16-year-old student from Staten Island Technical High School pursuing a major in computer
    science and a minor in business. I taught myself how to code in Python in my freetime and taught kids how to code in
    Python at the Brooklyn Public Library. Now I'm trying to learn how to code in Javascript because it was too hard to
    self-teach.
